Version 0.3

# Running steps:
python3 tetris.py

(You need python3 and the pygame library installed)

Doesn't work on macOS with python 3.7 or 3.7.1.
Please update to python >= 3.7.2 to play on a macOS.

Tested on Linux Mint with python 3.6 and macOS with python 3.7.3.

# Troubleshooting (2)
In case of dependencies error, install pygame with:
sudo pip3 install pygame

# Troubleshooting (3):
If the game doesn't work, try running the script provided in Linux:
chmod 777 prepare.sh
sudo ./prepare.sh
