# Tetris-in-Python

Port of Tetris in python.
Still isn't finished so it doesn't work properly.

## Running steps:
---
pip3 install pygame

python3 tetris.py


## Troubleshooting:
---
Doesn't work on macOS with python 3.7 or 3.7.1.
Please update to python >= 3.7.2 to play on a macOS.

Tested on Linux Mint with python 3.6 and macOS with python 3.7.3.

If the game doesn't work, try running the script provided in Linux:
sudo chmod 777 prepare.sh && ./prepare.sh


## Instructions
---
Start the game to play.
Press "SPACE" to rotate the tetramino (piece).
Press the left and right arrow keys to slide the piece to the respective side.
The game isn't finished so it's really buggy x)
